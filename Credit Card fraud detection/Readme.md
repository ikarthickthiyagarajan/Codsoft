Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses for credit card companies and their customers. Therefore, accurately identifying and preventing such transactions is of paramount importance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about credit card transactions. It includes features such as transaction amount, time, and various anonymized features derived from the transaction details. Each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate.

Dataset Source: Kaggle
